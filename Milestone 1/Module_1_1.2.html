<p>HTML, or <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, was invented by <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> in 1993 and was the first attempt to organize the growing amount of information on the internet. The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in <span>1993</span> and only contained 18 tags, including headings, paragraphs, basic text formatting, lists, hyperlinks, and images. The most widely used version throughout the 2000s was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in 1999. In 2014, HTML 5.0 was released, which is said to be an extended version of HTML 4.01. The latest version includes 145 HTML tags.</p>
